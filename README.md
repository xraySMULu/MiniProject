## Introduction

You will work in small groups to explore some datasets, then use your knowledge of preprocessing and model selection to create an application that incorporates a machine learning pipeline.

## What Regression Mini-Project does

In this mini project, we used preprocessing and model selection to create an application that incorporates a machine learning pipeline.
